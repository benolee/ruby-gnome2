Unimplementable?
----------------

GIOExtension

Other
-----

When we use GOBJ2RVAL on properties of objects, should we call G_CHILD_ADD?

g_unix_socket_address_new_abstract is deprecated

Need to document GLib::Socket

Glib::FileAttribute should be an object so that we can use | on them

GLib::InputStream#read_all can read bytes /and/ return error at the same time

GLib::OutputStream#write_all can write bytes /and/ return error at the same
time

GConverterFlags

GFileAttributeInfoList should be renamed

Remove implementation of methods that only fetch or set properties (and thus
are automatically generated anyway)

Update to 2.26
