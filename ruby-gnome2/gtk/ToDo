TODO List

C-Level Libraries

* check code around Garbage Collecter(Ruby, GTK+)
* more strict test for arguments
* cleanup the mess with "setter" methods: some widgets use
  #set_blah, some use #blah=, it's really inconsistent
* make the return value for void methods more consistent:
  some return 'self', others 'Qnil' -- pick one
* other GTK classes
    Gtk::Invisible
    Gtk::Packer
* Gtk::Widget issues
    - is #window a valid method?
    - should we also wrap #parent_window, #unlock_accelerators,
    #lock_accelerators
    - should #grab_default check that GTK_WIDGET_CAN_DEFAULT()
    first, or should it allow a GTK+ warning to come up?
* Gtk::Object
    - wrap #emit_signal, #emit_signal_by_name
* Gtk::CTree
    - make "is_something?" just "something?", add aliases for backwards compat
    - code cleanup
* GNOME (in development)
* Expose the GtkType enumeration (module Gtk::Type with constants)
* rewrite with SWIG or other like XS
* port to the next GTK+ (2.0, source-incompatible)
* update the copyright blurb for new maintainer and new year
* add a coding style document, so we can improve consistency

Ruby-Level Libraries

* base class for composite widget
* some composite widgets
* simple frameworks for typical applications
* Glade support (in development)
* XLFD(X Logical Font Description) manipulation library

Sample Scripts

* complete testgtk.rb
* collect more sample scripts for beginners

API Documents

* list up the all classes, constants and methods
* consider API suitable for Ruby
* describe these
