gnome-ruby -- Ruby bindings for GNOME
=====================================

*The current status of gnome-ruby is experimental*

This is a set of bindings for the GNOME libraries for use from Ruby.

To use them, you will need Ruby 1.6 and gnome-libs 1.0.50 or
later installed on your system.


Compilation and Installation
============================

To compile and install gnome-ruby, you should run:

  ruby extconf.rb
  make
  make site-install

To compile and install each sub-binding, you should run:

  cd <each sub-directory>
  ruby extconf.rb
  make
  make site-install

*NOTICE*
You should install a sub-binding with its dependencies.
The current dependencies are:

  gdkimlib depends on gtk.
  gdkpixbuf depends on gtk.
  gnome depends on gtk, gdkimlib.
