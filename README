gnome-ruby -- Ruby bindings for GNOME
=====================================

This is a set of bindings for the GNOME libraries for use from Ruby.

To use them, you will need Ruby 1.6 and gnome-libs 2.0.0 or
later installed on your system. Keep in mind that you will need both the
runtime libraries and the header files installed.

Compilation and Installation
============================

To compile and install all of the bindings included in this package,
you should run:

  ruby extconf.rb
  make
  make site-install

To compile and install a particular sub-binding, you should run:

  cd <each sub-directory>
  ruby extconf.rb
  make
  make site-install

*NOTICE*
You should install a sub-binding with its dependencies.
The current dependencies are:

  gdkpixbuf depends on gtk.
  gnome depends on gtk
