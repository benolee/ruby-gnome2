   They are aliases of GladeXML#getWidget, #getWidgetByLongName, #doConnect.

Wed Mar 20 01:45:43 2002 Neil Conway <neilconway@rogers.com>

	* rbglade.c: More bugfixes. Also, cGladeXML is no longer a
	sub-class of gObject (I thought this would work; apparently,
	it doesn't).

Tue Mar 19 01:21:17 2002 Neil Conway <neilconway@rogers.com>

	* rbglade.c: Fix a major bug in Gnome support (requiring changes
	in both Ruby-Gtk and Ruby-Gnome); make GladeXML a sub-class of
	gObject. Reported by Gary Lawrence Murphy <garym@canada.com>.

Sun Mar 17 16:04:38 2002 Neil Conway <neilconway@rogers.com>

	* rbglade.c: Fix a serious bug: don't use get_gobject().
        Reported by Gary Lawrence Murphy <garym@canada.com>.

Fri Mar 15 15:28:03 2002 Neil Conway <neilconway@rogers.com>

	* rbglade.c, extconf.rb: Add support for libglade-gnome.
	To enable this, pass the '--with-gnome' flag to extconf.rb,
	and you should be able to use Gnome widgets within your
	Ruby-libglade apps.

	* README: Add blurb on new support for libglade-gnome.

Fri Mar 15 14:40:12 2002 Neil Conway <neilconway@rogers.com>

	* rbglade.c: Misc cleanups and improvements, mostly from my
	previous patch.

	* README: Update for new maintainer.

Fri Mar 15 14:15:43 2002 Neil Conway <neilconway@rogers.com>

	* lib/libglade.rb: Remove file.

	* rbglade.c: Replace our version with the current upstream code.
	Avi asked me to adopt this package, so the version in this CVS
	tree is now the official package, and future releases of Ruby-Gnome
	will include Ruby-libglade as a sub-binding.

Tue Dec 18 18:36:10 2001 Neil Conway <neilconway@rogers.com>

	* rbglade.c: Code cleanup; fix compiler warnings; change the
	storage location of the pointer to the Glade XML gObject;
        make it a sub-class of (the Ruby class) Gtk::Object.

Tue Dec 11 20:24:38 2001  Hiroshi IGARASHI  <iga@ruby-lang.org>

	* extconf.rb: Fixed; it should use libglade-config,
	not gtk-config.

Sat Nov 24 16:30:32 2001 Neil Conway <neilconway@rogers.com>

	* MANIFEST: File removed.

Tue May 22 06:33:43 2001  Hiroshi IGARASHI  <iga@ruby-lang.org>

	* import Ruby/LibGlade.
