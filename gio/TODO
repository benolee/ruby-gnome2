We should probably use GOBJ2RVAL_UNREF a lot more, possibly every time the
documentation mentions that g_object_unref should be used.  Need to do this
with GLIST2ARYF as well.

When we use GOBJ2RVAL on properties of objects, should we call G_CHILD_ADD?

Rewrite rbg_cstr2rval_with_free to ensure that we call g_free, even if
rb_str_new2 fails.  (And the same for other such methods.)
